@CacheLookup -- is used to improve the performance of the script execution. It will store in the separate cache 
Example: @FindBy(xpath = "//td[contains(text(),'Contacts')]")
	     @CacheLookup
	     WebElement contactsLabel;

Example: @FindBy(id="first_name")
         @CacheLookup
	     WebElement firstname;
	     
Disadvantage is if the cache memory is corrupted then it will display stale element Exception 

Web Driver Fire Event: to generate selenium action logs
- This class implements the WebDriverEventListener, which is included under events.
 The purpose of implementing this interface is to override all the methods and define certain useful  Log statements 
 which would be displayed/logged as the application under test is being run.
 Do not call any of these methods, instead these methods will be invoked automatically
 as an when the action done (click, findBy etc).
